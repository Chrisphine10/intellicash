# Savings Account → Account Type → Bank Account Chain Verification

## ✅ **YES, this is exactly the case!**

The system correctly implements the relationship chain you described:

**Savings Account → Account Type (Savings Product) → Bank Account**

## Relationship Chain Confirmed

### 1. Database Structure
```
transactions.savings_account_id → savings_accounts.id
savings_accounts.savings_product_id → savings_products.id  
savings_products.bank_account_id → bank_accounts.id
```

### 2. Model Relationships
```
Transaction → SavingsAccount (via savings_account_id)
SavingsAccount → SavingsProduct (via savings_product_id)
SavingsProduct → BankAccount (via bank_account_id)
```

### 3. Code Flow in BankingService
```php
// Step 1: Get savings account from transaction
$savingsAccount = $transaction->account;

// Step 2: Get account type (savings product) from savings account  
$savingsProduct = $savingsAccount->savings_type;

// Step 3: Get bank account from account type
$bankAccount = $savingsProduct->bank_account;

// Step 4: Create bank transaction
$bankTransaction->bank_account_id = $bankAccount->id;

// Step 5: Update bank account balance
$this->updateBankAccountBalance($bankAccount, $amount, $dr_cr);
```
