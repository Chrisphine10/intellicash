# Lease Request System Implementation Summary

## Overview
Successfully implemented a comprehensive lease request system that allows members to request asset leases and pay from their savings accounts. The system integrates with the existing asset management module and provides both member-facing and admin interfaces.

## Features Implemented

### 1. Database Structure
- **LeaseRequest Model**: Complete model with relationships to Member, Asset, SavingsAccount, and User
- **Database Migration**: Created `lease_requests` table with all necessary fields
- **Relationships**: Added lease request relationships to Member model

### 2. Core Functionality
- **Member Lease Requests**: Members can submit lease requests for available assets
- **Payment Integration**: Automatic payment processing from member's savings account
- **Admin Approval/Rejection**: Admin can approve or reject requests with notes
- **Automatic Lease Creation**: Approved requests automatically create active leases
- **Balance Validation**: System checks sufficient account balance before approval

### 3. User Interface

#### Member Interface
- **Request Form**: Complete form with asset selection, duration, payment account selection
- **Request History**: View all submitted requests with status tracking
- **Request Details**: Detailed view of individual requests

- **Asset Management Integration**: Seamlessly integrated with existing asset management

### 5. Business Logic
- **Asset Availability Check**: Ensures only available assets can be requested
- **Account Validation**: Verifies payment account belongs to requesting member
- **Balance Verification**: Checks sufficient funds before processing

- **Status Management**: Tracks request lifecycle from pending to approved/rejected

### 6. Security and Validation
